# Week-1-Assignment-of-ChatBot-using-NLP
As an intern of Edunet foundation , in my week 1 I worked upon basics of NLP so as to implement a chatbot using NLP whose crux is to use intents.

# Overview
Other than the specific assigned tasks , I included some of my own intents to understand the working more thoroughly. Below are the steps how I proceeded through the whole assignment:
 # 1.) Download dependencies / packages 
 To move on with the basics of NLP it is necessary to know the packages that are important to be downloaded. Such as:
 pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit 

 # 2.) Import needed libraries
 I imported libraries like nltk, random, os, scikit-learn and so on to move smoothly.

 # 3.) Downloading punkt package and tokenizers
 ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
 nltk.data.path.append(os.path.abspath('nltk_data'))
 nltk.download('punkt')

 # 4.) Work on intents- Final Step
 Intents includes what are the basic responses that you would expect from your chatbot . I included some intents like greeting,about,budget,weather and many more.


 # Conclusion
 It was fun to learn to create chatbot from NLP and ofcourse I've walked steps and need to run for miles now. Meaning there's a lot that still can be added to make this chatbot more interactive , user-friendly and efficient with its tasks. Stay tuned for further progress and the upcoming assignments where I'll showcase my further in-depth knowledge in NLP.
